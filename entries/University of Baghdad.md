#University of Baghdad

The College of Islamic Sciences claims that it originated in 1067 A.D. as Abu-Haneefa.[3] However, the College of Law, the earliest of the modern institutions that were to become the first constituent Colleges (i.e. Faculties) of the University of Baghdad, was founded in 1908.[4]
